##Discription
            This project is a text-to-speech converter web application, built as the final project for the CS50x course. The app allows users to type in text and hear it read aloud by the computer, with options to adjust the voice, rate, and pitch for a personalized experience. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project explores web development fundamentals and practical applications of JavaScript APIs, specifically the Web Speech API for speech synthesis.

#Project Overview
        The Text-to-Speech Converter web app is designed to help users convert written text into spoken audio in a straightforward, accessible way. This is particularly useful for individuals who prefer auditory learning, need assistance with reading, or simply enjoy listening to text. The app provides several options for customizing playback, including:

        Voice selection (based on available voices in the user's browser)
        Adjustable speech rate (speed)
        Adjustable pitch (tone)
        Motivation
        The project showcases the power of JavaScript in building functional web applications and explores the Web Speech API’s capabilities. This project was also inspired by a desire to provide a basic, easily accessible text-to-speech tool that could be helpful for users with different needs, including those with visual impairments or reading challenges.


#Features
        Text-to-Speech Conversion: Converts any text entered into audio output, with controls for playback.
        Voice Selection: Allows users to choose different voices based on the voices available on their system or browser, providing variety in the audio experience.
        Adjustable Speech Rate: Users can speed up or slow down the reading pace, enabling a tailored experience for faster or slower audio playback.
        Adjustable Pitch: The pitch slider allows users to adjust the tone of the voice, making it sound deeper or higher according to preference.
        Simple User Interface: The interface is minimalistic and easy to navigate, making it accessible even for first-time users.



#Technologies Used
        The following technologies and libraries were used to develop the Text-to-Speech Converter:

        HTML5: Provides the structure for the application, setting up the main components such as input fields and buttons.
        CSS3: Enhances the UI with styling, ensuring a clean and modern look.
        JavaScript (ES6): Handles the core functionality, including the speech synthesis and controls for voice options, rate, and pitch.
        Web Speech API: A built-in browser API that enables speech synthesis, allowing text input to be read aloud by the computer.


#Getting Started
        To run this project, you’ll only need a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.) that supports the Web Speech API.

        Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
        bash
        Copy code
        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-to-speech-converter.git
        Navigate to the project directory:
        bash
        Copy code
        cd text-to-speech-converter
        Open index.html in your browser:
        Simply double-click on index.html, or you can drag and drop the file into your browser.


#Setup Instructions
        This project is a front-end-only application, so no additional installation or backend setup is required. Once you have cloned the repository and opened index.html in your browser, you are ready to start using the app.



#Usage
    To use the Text-to-Speech Converter, follow these steps:

        Enter Text: Type any text you want to convert to speech in the text area provided.
        Select a Voice: Use the dropdown menu to select a preferred voice if multiple options are available. The available voices depend on the browser and system configuration, and may vary.
        Adjust Speech Rate: Use the rate slider to increase or decrease the playback speed. Moving it to the left will slow it down, while moving it to the right will speed it up.
        Adjust Pitch: The pitch slider lets you modify the tone of the voice, making it higher or lower as desired.
        Play Speech: Click the "Play" button to listen to the text you entered. The audio will begin playing based on your selected settings.
        Stop Speech: You can stop the playback by clicking the "Stop" button.
        Note
        Make sure your browser supports the Web Speech API for full functionality, as some browsers may have limited support or different available voices.


#Limitations
        Voice Options: Voice availability may vary based on the user’s browser and operating system.
        Browser Dependency: This app relies on browser support for the Web Speech API, which may not be available on all browsers.
        No Offline Functionality: The app requires a browser environment, so it may not work offline on some devices.


#Future Improvements
        Here are some ideas to improve the Text-to-Speech Converter in future versions:

        Save as MP3 Feature: Add functionality to save the audio output as an MP3 file for later use.
        Expanded Language Support: Extend the app to support more languages, which would make it useful for users across different regions and linguistic backgrounds.
        Enhanced User Interface: Improve the design for better usability and aesthetics, possibly with animations or additional themes.
        Error Handling: Add error handling for scenarios where the Web Speech API is unsupported or when users attempt actions not available on their browser.
